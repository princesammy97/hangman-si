Sam Inkaya, Hangman, samuelwinkaya@lewisu.edu

Just like in a basic game of Hangman, players will have to guess the word that is chosen by picking a letter. If they get it right, the letter will be placed on the line. If they get it wrong, the host will start drawing a stick figure hanging. 
Players win by guessing the correct word. Players lose if a stick figure is fully drawn.
