    <h1>Hangman</h1>
    <p> Just like in a basic game of Hangman, players will have to guess the word that is chosen by picking a letter. If they get it right, the letter will be placed on the line. If they get it wrong, the host will start drawing a stick figure hanging. 
        Players win by guessing the correct word. Players lose if a stick figure is fully drawn. </p>
    <p> I orignally planned to have two players play this game and give it a stylish interface that stands out.</p>
    <p>I implemented the Hangman game in a web page and stylized it using CSS but haven't made it where two players can play. </p>
    <p>If I had more time, I would include a Hangman animation where it would draw the stick figure and the letters you pick will appear.</p>
